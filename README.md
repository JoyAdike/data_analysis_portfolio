## About
Hi, I'm Joy! I have a strong foundation in data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, and hold a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics. With a background in social media management, I have honed my ability to analyze user engagement and SEO metrics to drive data-driven marketing strategies. My technical expertise includes advanced Excel, SQL, Python, and tools like Tableau, and PowerBI, which I use to transform raw data into actionable insights that solve business challenges. My experience utilizing tools like HubSpot and Meta Business Suite has given me a unique perspective on how data analytics can optimize marketing efforts and improve overall business performance.
