# Joy Adike - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Joy! I have a strong foundation in data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, and I hold a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics. With a background in social media management, I have honed my ability to analyze user engagement and SEO metrics to drive data-driven marketing strategies. My technical expertise includes advanced Excel, SQL, Python, and tools like Tableau, and PowerBI, which I use to transform raw data into actionable insights that solve business challenges. My experience utilizing tools like HubSpot and Meta Business Suite has given me a unique perspective on how data analytics can optimize marketing efforts and improve overall business performance.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Digital Marketing Analysis
**Code:** [fresh_segments.sql](./fresh_segments.sql)

**Description:** A case study created by datawithdanny.com 

**Setup:** Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyze trends in online ad click behavior for their unique customer base. Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.
In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.
Danny has asked for your help to see aggregated metrics for an example client and give some high-level insights about the customer list and their interests.
